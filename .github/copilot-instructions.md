# Copilot Instructions for AI Agents

## Project Overview
This is a minimal static website project consisting of a single `index.html` file. The site currently displays a simple "Hello, World!" message and is titled "Nural Rahmanli".

## Key Files
- `index.html`: The main and only file. Contains all HTML for the site.

## Architecture & Patterns
- No frameworks, build tools, or external dependencies are present.
- All logic and content reside in `index.html`.
- No CSS, JavaScript, or asset directories exist yet.

## Developer Workflows
- No build or test steps are required. Open `index.html` directly in a browser to view changes.
- No package management or dependency installation is needed.

## Project Conventions
- Keep all content in `index.html` unless new requirements justify additional files.
- Use semantic HTML where possible.
- If adding new files (e.g., CSS, JS), place them in the project root or create appropriate folders (e.g., `css/`, `js/`).
- Maintain simplicity and minimalism unless the project scope expands.

## Examples
- To update the homepage message, edit the `<body>` section of `index.html`.
- To add a stylesheet, create `style.css` and link it in the `<head>`.

## Integration Points
- None currently. No external APIs, scripts, or services are integrated.
